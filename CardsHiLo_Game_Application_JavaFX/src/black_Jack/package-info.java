/** BLACKJACK - BASICS
 * 
 * Blackjack (also called "21") is a fun and enjoyable casino card game. The basic rules of blackjack are quite easy to learn.
 * 
 * As the name 21 implies, the object of the game is to come as close to 21 points as possible with your cards -- without going over -- and having a higher total than the dealer.
 * 
 * The game begins with the player placing a bet, then receiving two cards face up. The dealer also receives two cards.
 * 
 * The player wins the amount that was bet if the total value of his cards is closer to 21 than the dealer's cards. Another way to win is if the dealer goes over 21, while the player does not.
 * 
 * The player loses the amount bet if his total goes over 21.

/** BLACKJACK - RULES
 * 
 * The game of blackjack is dealt with six decks of cards (to prevent card counting), and after each hand (or a set number of hands), the cards are re-shuffled.
 * 
 * The dealer must continue drawing cards if the value of his two cards is 17 points or less, while the player can stop at any time.
 * 
 * The Player can split his cards when dealt cards of the same value (for instance, 6-6 or J-Q), doubling his opportunity to play that particular hand. Split aces receive only one additional card.

/** BLACKJACK - CARD VALUES
 * 
 * In blackjack, the suits of the cards have no significance.
 * 
 * Cards 2 through 10 have face value (for instance, 10 is worth 10 points).
 * 
 * Jacks, queens and kings are each valued at 10 points.
 * 
 * Aces are valued at either 11 or 1, depending on which is more advantageous to the player.*
