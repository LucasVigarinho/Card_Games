/**
 * /** 
 * 
 * (a) Create a project called 'CardsHiLoGUI'. Create a main interface for the
 * application similar to that shown in Figure 1. Remember to create a ToggleGroup
 * for the radio buttons and set the ToggleGroup for each button to ensure mutual
 * exclusivity. At application startup, the card images are populated with default
 * cards. Use comments in your code to explain your approach in relation to the GUI
 * construction. 
 * 
 * (b) Add a menu bar and 'File' menu. The 'File' menu should contain the items 'New
 * Game', 'Shuffle' and 'Exit'. Implement these menu items fully. Add a 'Help' menu
 * with an 'About' item to show your student name and number in a dialog.
 * 
 * (c) Create classes for Card and DeckOfCards to help manage the game. The Card
 * class should include methods such as isEqual( ), isLower( ), isHigher( ) and
 * toString( ). The class DeckOfCards should include methods such as
 * dealTopCard( ), isEmpty( ) and shuffle( ). Provide one or more constructors as
 * appropriate for each class.
 * 
 * (d) Implement dealing of each card, determination of a win/lose and user feedback in
 * a label as shown in Figure 1. Store wins and inform the user of an overall game
 * win on achieving 5 consecutive, correct guesses.
 * 
 * (e) Add a progress bar and progress indicator to indicate progress towards 5
 * consecutive wins leading to an overall game win. Provide appropriate feedback on
 * achieving an overall game win. Use a stylesheet to apply an attractive look and
 * feel to the application.
